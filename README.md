#Podium#
Many motorcyclists love Italian motorbikes. It is said that they have characters, personalities, and traits that remain in your heart. Unfortunately, they also seem to have
electrical and mechanical issues, and numerous foibles that can ruin ownership. Dealers are expensive and hard to locate for many models, older bikes can be 'money pits' if
they are taken to a normal mechanic. Podium are here to rectify that.

This is the site for Podium, based in North Wales (home to some of the best motorcycling roads in the country!), they are specialists in the maintenance, repair and upgrading
of Italian motorcycles. With over 50 years experience and a geniune passion for Italian Moto-Exotica, they provide a professional, bespoke service. Whether it is a simple MOT test, an engine rebuild, or preparing your bike for the TT, Podium can handle it.

##Testing##

Once the 'Love Running' project was completed, I realised that it would be prudent to begin with a 'Mobile First' methodology in the design, production and implementation
of the Podium site. Utilizing Google's DevTools, upon every content and style change I viewed the site at various display sizes and aspect ratios. This allowed me to
check whether the responsive design ethos was being maintained.
In my experimentation with new (new to me anyway!) rules, selectors and declarations I relied upon <https://caniuse.com/ciu/comparison>. Subsequently I could keep track of
any browsers that may not support the code I wanted to use. I choose not to use any 'experimental' code, sticking instead to wel-tested and supported examples.

**Browser Options**
The Podium site was created via Google Chrome Version 117.0.5938.132. Below is a list of the other browsers in which it has been viewed.
Microsoft Edge Version 117.0.2045.43:
Mozilla Firefox Version 118.0.1:
Opera by Opera:

**Validator Testing**
HTML5 [https://validator.w3.org]
Error: 1 Bad value 100% for attribute width on element iframe: Expected a digit but saw % instead. This is how the width of the map on the Home page was set. Three different sources that I have utilized (developer.mozilla.org, w3schools.com and stackoverflow.com) recommended the use of the percentage unit to guarantee the design was responsive.
Info: 27 Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values. I have removed these numerous times but they are restored upon reopening. I will have to find out whether this is a feature in the IDE that can be reset.

##Unfixed Bugs##
On the 'About' page, under the 'Meet the Team' section, there are 3 images of the team members; Gio, Raph and Eva. Each image is repositioned slightly as the browser resizes however the image of Eva resizes considerably more and her face is lost.

##Deployment##
The site was deployed to GitHub pages.

##Credits##
I must give credit Jo Heyndels, a Content Developer for Code Institute, for the 'Footer' code and that in the 'Gallery' and 'Sign Up' pages. This code was taken from her 'Love Running' project, part of the initial module of Code Institute's Full Stack Developer Course. The sign up box has been restyled but the code was copied.

For the Header, code from the Skillthrive YouTube Channel was utilized. Link: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwWHL3RyQgk&ab_channel=Skillthrive>

In in all of the cases above, I made numerous attempts to achieve a similar result. However, my code was always longer and didn't produce the desired result. Subsequently I used the code from the sources credited above.

The pictorial icons used throughout the site are taken from Font Awesome website. Link <https://fontawesome.com/>
