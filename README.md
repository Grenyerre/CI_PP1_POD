# Podium #
Many motorcyclists love Italian motorbikes. It is said that they have characters, personalities, and traits that remain in your heart. Unfortunately, they also seem to have
electrical and mechanical issues, and numerous foibles that can ruin ownership. Dealers are expensive and hard to locate for many models, older bikes can be 'money pits' if
they are taken to a normal mechanic. Podium are here to rectify that.

This is the site for Podium, based in North Wales (home to some of the best motorcycling roads in the country!), they are specialists in the maintenance, repair and upgrading
of Italian motorcycles. With over 50 years experience and a geniune passion for Italian Moto-Exotica, they provide a professional, bespoke service. Whether it is a simple MOT test, an engine rebuild, or preparing your bike for the TT, Podium can handle it.

## Testing ##

Once the 'Love Running' project was completed, I realised that it would be prudent to begin with a 'Mobile First' methodology in the design, production and implementation
of the Podium site. Utilizing Google's DevTools, upon every content and style change I viewed the site at various display sizes and aspect ratios. This allowed me to
check whether the responsive design ethos was being maintained.
In my experimentation with new (new to me anyway!) rules, selectors and declarations I relied upon <https://caniuse.com/ciu/comparison>. Subsequently I could keep track of
any browsers that may not support the code I wanted to use. I choose not to use any 'experimental' code, sticking instead to wel-tested and supported examples.

**Browser Options**
The Podium site was created via Google Chrome. Below is a list of the other browsers in which it has been viewed. Any browser specific idiosyncrasies are listed below:
